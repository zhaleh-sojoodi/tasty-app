# Final Project: Recipe App
> Members: Nicole, Zhaleh, Anthony, Vibha

 'Tasty' is a MERN stack app we had built. It incorporated everything we had learned in the previous 1 week, including React, Node, Express and MongoDB.

## Roles
**Frontend**: Nicole, Anthony<br>
**Backend**: Zhaleh, Vibha

## Technologies Used
<ul>
 <li>ReactJs</li>
 <li>Javascript</li>
 <li>NodeJs</li>
 <li>Express</li>
 <li>MongoDb</li>
 <li>Mongoose</li>
 <li>Google Clouds</li>
</ul>

## Brief
In 9 days and in groups of 4 we had to:
<ul>
 <li>Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and our own front-end</li>
 <li>Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React</li>
 <li>Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality</li>
 <li>Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know layout of project</li>
 
</ul>

## Must Have Features
* Users can register and login with an account
* Users can create new recipes
* Users can 'like' a recipe
* Users can give a rating to a recipe (stars)
* Users can delete their own recipes
* Users can search for recipes with keywords
* Users have profiles displaying their own recipes and recipes they've liked

## Future Enhancements
* Users can 'follow' other users to see their recipes on their dashboard
* Additional 'Categories' page to browse recipes
* Add date that recipe was created

## Nice To Have Features
* Users can see related recipes on a recipe page
* Users can add nutritional information to their recipes
* Users can search for other users
* Users can print out recipes

## Communication Plan
Meet everyday for up to 30 minutes.

## Key Learnings
This project was a a brilliant learning curve about working in a group, managing team dynamics and delegating code accordingly as well as helping over come problems together. As git master we had to make sure everyone was working together and avoiding conflicts in our code. 

Apart from working as a team, We learned the process of creating a back end, and connecting it to a front end successfully, from the very beginning to presenting our finished product.
